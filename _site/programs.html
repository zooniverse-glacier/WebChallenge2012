            <p>The birth-seeds of our growth, the ideals that led to our organizations inception, were planted by volunteers. The execution of our mission is rooted in person to person interaction. We don’t believe in just sending resources to a faraway land, we believe in getting our hands dirty side-by-side the people we are serving. Through that work and the relationships we create along the way we believe this creates collective empowerment to accompany the impact of education. We believe that PED has as much to learn from those we seek to empower as they do from the educational structure we want to provide for them.</p>

<p>Our volunteer program in Uganda is centered around 2 to 4 week trips that work to establish our projects with our partner schools. Volunteers may work on projects in any one of the three phases that the schools are in. Through their hard work, inadequate soccer skills, and connections made with students as well as community members, our volunteers serve as the human connection to our work. When you join one of our volunteer trips, you are not only joining a team, but becoming a member of the larger PED family. You become a part of a movement of people striving to improve the communities we live in, working together to make large scale changes here at home and around the world. With this, we hope you join us.</p>

<h3 id='threephase_program'>Three-phase program</h3>

<p>Our projects in Uganda partner with schools to create sustainable programs which seek to provide an education to empower students to be the change leaders in their own lives and the communities they live in. In order to accomplish this we partner with schools to implement these projects to address current challenges and equip them to manage ones they will face on their own. We do this in three phases which typically range from 3-7 years. Check out what each one is all about below:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Phase 1</strong>: A solid foundation is essential for the success of any project. In our first phase we aim to create, and sometimes fix, cracked foundations essential for learning and sustainability to occur.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Phase 2</strong>: For self-guided empowerment to occur certain barriers need to be eliminated. For schools across Uganda, these are financial barriers. We seek to create financial independence for each of our partner schools through the establishment of micro-finance projects. These projects serve two purposes. The first is to become an educational asset to the school. The second is to serve as a source of sustainable income for the school.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Phase 3</strong>: In our final phases we aim to make sure each of our partner schools meet a standard of excellence that they both deserve and can maintain. We determine this by our core pillars of Knowledge, Community, Health, and Recreation.</p>

      <h2><strong>PED U</strong></h2>

      <div class="two columns">
        

        <div class="">
          <div class="content markdownSection">
            <p>PED U is PED’s initiative dedicated to serving the needs of our own communities. Through recognition of local issues and meaningful service in our neighborhoods and cities, PED U and our team of college students are dedicated to creating a network of innovative thinkers and activists working to empower youth and their educational communities.</p>

<h3 id='pillars_of_the_program'>Pillars of the Program:</h3>

<h4 id='service'>Service:</h4>

<p>At PED, we believe that Service is an integral part of who we are. Serving a community is something deeper than just putting on work clothes and working; there must be thought, intent, and consciousness behind it. And that’s the beauty of it: Service doesn’t need to be epic or grand to make a difference. An act as small as tutoring students on a weekly basis or cleaning up local parks and schools can be “good” Service if there is thoughtfulness and reflection behind it. Your meaningful Service is defined by your consciousness behind it.</p>

<h4 id='awareness'>Awareness:</h4>

<p>Awareness leads to knowledge and empowerment. PED U members develop Awareness of the problems facing local schools and in turn act as advocates for educational justice by promoting this Awareness within their communities. We identify the most prevalent problems facing each student population and promote solutions to these problems through social media, word-of-mouth, and, most importantly, hands-on work with students. By empowering community members with knowledge and tools, PED U supports them in tackling issues on their own.</p>

<h4 id='fundraising'>Fundraising:</h4>

<p>Although Fundraising is a core pillar of PED U, it is integral to Service and should be used as a tool to enhance it. The focus for Fundraising should be on the needs of your community and your Service.</p>

<h4 id='community'>Community:</h4>

<p>Community is the foundation that the other pillars rest upon. In every Community we engage in, we give ourselves in different ways. Sometimes, Service can be can be exhausting, raising Awareness can be taxing, and Fundraising can be frustrating. As important as each of these actions are in working toward educational justice, we prioritize having fun while doing it and recognizing both small and large successes. For PED U members, Community comes from the support network we provide to each other.</p>

          <div class="content markdownSection">
            <p>Within the school communities PED partners with abroad, young women are particularly at risk of leaving school before reaching higher education or attaining their desired career goals.</p>

<p>As a response to this issue, PED established Pangea’s Opportunities for Women (POW) in the fall of 2012, giving rise to projects that focus on four facets of women’s empowerment: health, self-advocacy, higher education, and entrepreneurship.</p>

<p>In Uganda, POW’s projects help women become successful despite obstacles, including household responsibilities, forced child marriage in exchange for dowry, rape or sexual coercion, early pregnancy, HIV/AIDS, domestic violence, and the inability to pay school fees due to a lack of job opportunities. In addition to creating and sustaining these projects, POW focuses on facilitating a community in which young men work as allies for women’s empowerment.</p>
