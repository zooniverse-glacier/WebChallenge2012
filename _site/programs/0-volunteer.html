<p>The birth-seeds of our growth, the ideals that led to our organizations inception, were planted by volunteers. The execution of our mission is rooted in person to person interaction. We donâ€™t believe in just sending resources to a faraway land, we believe in getting our hands dirty side-by-side the people we are serving. Through that work and the relationships we create along the way we believe this creates collective empowerment to accompany the impact of education. We believe that PED has as much to learn from those we seek to empower as they do from the educational structure we want to provide for them.</p>

<p>Our volunteer program in Uganda is centered around 2 to 4 week trips that work to establish our projects with our partner schools. Volunteers may work on projects in any one of the three phases that the schools are in. Through their hard work, inadequate soccer skills, and connections made with students as well as community members, our volunteers serve as the human connection to our work. When you join one of our volunteer trips, you are not only joining a team, but becoming a member of the larger PED family. You become a part of a movement of people striving to improve the communities we live in, working together to make large scale changes here at home and around the world. With this, we hope you join us.</p>

<h3 id='threephase_program'>Three-phase program</h3>

<p>Our projects in Uganda partner with schools to create sustainable programs which seek to provide an education to empower students to be the change leaders in their own lives and the communities they live in. In order to accomplish this we partner with schools to implement these projects to address current challenges and equip them to manage ones they will face on their own. We do this in three phases which typically range from 3-7 years. Check out what each one is all about below:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Phase 1</strong>: A solid foundation is essential for the success of any project. In our first phase we aim to create, and sometimes fix, cracked foundations essential for learning and sustainability to occur.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Phase 2</strong>: For self-guided empowerment to occur certain barriers need to be eliminated. For schools across Uganda, these are financial barriers. We seek to create financial independence for each of our partner schools through the establishment of micro-finance projects. These projects serve two purposes. The first is to become an educational asset to the school. The second is to serve as a source of sustainable income for the school.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Phase 3</strong>: In our final phases we aim to make sure each of our partner schools meet a standard of excellence that they both deserve and can maintain. We determine this by our core pillars of Knowledge, Community, Health, and Recreation.</p>
