      <p>PED U is PED’s initiative dedicated to serving the needs of our own communities. Through recognition of local issues and meaningful service in our neighborhoods and cities, PED U and our team of college students are dedicated to creating a network of innovative thinkers and activists working to empower youth and their educational communities.</p>

<h1 id='pillars_of_program'>Pillars of Program:</h1>

<h2 id='service'>Service:</h2>

<p>At PED, we believe that Service is an integral part of who we are. Serving a community is something deeper than just putting on work clothes and working; there must be thought, intent, and consciousness behind it. And that’s the beauty of it: Service doesn’t need to be epic or grand to make a difference. An act as small as tutoring students on a weekly basis or cleaning up local parks and schools can be “good” Service if there is thoughtfulness and reflection behind it. Your meaningful Service is defined by your consciousness behind it.</p>

<h2 id='awareness'>Awareness:</h2>

<p>Awareness leads to knowledge and empowerment. PED U members develop Awareness of the problems facing local schools and in turn act as advocates for educational justice by promoting this Awareness within their communities. We identify the most prevalent problems facing each student population and promote solutions to these problems through social media, word-of-mouth, and, most importantly, hands-on work with students. By empowering community members with knowledge and tools, PED U supports them in tackling issues on their own.</p>

<h2 id='fundraising'>Fundraising:</h2>

<p>Although Fundraising is a core pillar of PED U, it is integral to Service and should be used as a tool to enhance it. The focus for Fundraising should be on the needs of your community and your Service.</p>

<h2 id='community'>Community:</h2>

<p>Community is the foundation that the other pillars rest upon. In every Community we engage in, we give ourselves in different ways. Sometimes, Service can be can be exhausting, raising Awareness can be taxing, and Fundraising can be frustrating. As important as each of these actions are in working toward educational justice, we prioritize having fun while doing it and recognizing both small and large successes. For PED U members, Community comes from the support network we provide to each other.</p>
