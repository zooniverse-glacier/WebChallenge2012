We are Pangea Educational Development, but you can call us PED for short. Our mission is to empower students and unite communities through the development of sustainable school sites in under-resourced areas â€“ from Uganda to Michigan to Illinois, with an ever-growing reach. We are a 501(c)3 non-profit organization dedicated to providing essential resources to schools and creating sustainable education programs that ensure the wellbeing of students around the world.
