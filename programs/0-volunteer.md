The birth-seeds of our growth, the ideals that led to our organizations inception, were planted by volunteers. The execution of our mission is rooted in person to person interaction. We donâ€™t believe in just sending resources to a faraway land, we believe in getting our hands dirty side-by-side the people we are serving. Through that work and the relationships we create along the way we believe this creates collective empowerment to accompany the impact of education. We believe that PED has as much to learn from those we seek to empower as they do from the educational structure we want to provide for them.

Our volunteer program in Uganda is centered around 2 to 4 week trips that work to establish our projects with our partner schools. Volunteers may work on projects in any one of the three phases that the schools are in. Through their hard work, inadequate soccer skills, and connections made with students as well as community members, our volunteers serve as the human connection to our work. When you join one of our volunteer trips, you are not only joining a team, but becoming a member of the larger PED family. You become a part of a movement of people striving to improve the communities we live in, working together to make large scale changes here at home and around the world. With this, we hope you join us.
