Within the school communities PED partners with abroad, young women are particularly at risk of leaving school before reaching higher education or attaining their desired career goals.

As a response to this issue, PED established Pangea’s Opportunities for Women (POW) in the fall of 2012, giving rise to projects that focus on four facets of women’s empowerment: health, self-advocacy, higher education, and entrepreneurship.

In Uganda, POW’s projects help women become successful despite obstacles, including household responsibilities, forced child marriage in exchange for dowry, rape or sexual coercion, early pregnancy, HIV/AIDS, domestic violence, and the inability to pay school fees due to a lack of job opportunities. In addition to creating and sustaining these projects, POW focuses on facilitating a community in which young men work as allies for women’s empowerment.
