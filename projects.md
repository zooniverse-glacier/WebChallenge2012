## Abroad
Our projects in Uganda partner with schools to create sustainable programs which seek to provide an education to empower students to be the change leaders in their own lives and the communities they live in. In order to accomplish this we partner with schools to implement these projects to address current challenges and equip them to manage ones they will face on their own. We do this in three phases which typically range from 3-7 years. Check out what each one is all about below:
 
-  Phase 1: A solid foundation is essential for the success of any project. In our first phase we aim to create, and sometimes fix, cracked foundations essential for learning and sustainability to occur.
-  Phase 2: For self-guided empowerment to occur certain barriers need to be eliminated. For schools across Uganda, these are financial barriers. We seek to create financial independence for each of our partner schools through the establishment of micro-finance projects. These projects serve two purposes. The first is to become an educational asset to the school. The second is to serve as a source of sustainable income for the school.
-  Phase 3: In our final phases we aim to make sure each of our partner schools meet a standard of excellence that they both deserve and can maintain. We determine this by our core pillars of Knowledge, Community, Health, and Recreation.
